🎨 AI Poster Generator — Full-Stack Serverless Application

A production-oriented, full-stack AI image generation platform built with Next.js and AWS, featuring secure authentication, credit enforcement, generation history, and serverless scalability.

This project demonstrates end-to-end system design, not just AI integration — from frontend UX to backend enforcement and cloud infrastructure.

🚀 Features

✨ Text-to-Image Generation powered by Amazon Bedrock

🔐 Secure Authentication using Amazon Cognito + NextAuth

🎟️ Credit Enforcement System (atomic, server-side, abuse-safe)

🧾 Generation History API with pagination & TTL cleanup

🖼️ Secure Image Delivery via S3 pre-signed URLs

⚡ Serverless & Scalable Architecture

🏗️ Infrastructure as Code using Terraform

🧠 Architecture Overview

High-level flow:

User submits a prompt via the Next.js frontend

Frontend calls Next.js API routes (/api/generate, /api/history)

Requests are forwarded to AWS API Gateway (HTTP API)

JWT authorizer (Cognito) validates the request

AWS Lambda (Python):

Enforces user credits (DynamoDB)

Calls Amazon Bedrock for image generation

Stores results in Amazon S3

Records history with TTL in DynamoDB

Client receives a pre-signed S3 URL for secure access

🔒 All credit enforcement and authorization happen server-side — never in the browser.

🏗️ Tech Stack
Frontend

Next.js (App Router)

TypeScript

NextAuth

Backend

AWS Lambda (Python 3.11)

AWS API Gateway (HTTP API)

Amazon Bedrock (Text-to-Image)

Data & Storage

Amazon DynamoDB

Credits tracking

Generation history (with TTL)

Amazon S3 (generated images)

Auth & Security

Amazon Cognito (User Pool + JWT)

API Gateway JWT Authorizer

Pre-signed S3 URLs

Infrastructure

Terraform (IaC)

Fully reproducible environments

🔐 Credit Enforcement (Key Design Detail)

Credits are enforced atomically in DynamoDB using conditional updates:

Credits are initialized automatically on first use

Each generation:

Atomically decrements credits

Fails safely if credits = 0

Failed generations trigger best-effort refunds

Prevents:

Race conditions

Client-side tampering

Abuse via concurrent requests

This design mirrors real SaaS billing enforcement patterns.

📜 History API

GET /api/history

Returns:

Prompt

Status (SUCCESS / FAILED)

Timestamp

Pre-signed image URL (for successful runs)

Supports:

Pagination via cursor

Automatic expiry via DynamoDB TTL

Used by the dashboard UI to display past generations
