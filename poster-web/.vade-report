# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

## Summary
Successfully configured Vercel Speed Insights for the Next.js 16.1.6 application using the App Router.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files:
- **app/layout.tsx**: Added the `<SpeedInsights />` component to the root layout

### Implementation Details:
1. The `@vercel/speed-insights` package (v1.3.1) was already installed in the project
2. The import statement was already present: `import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/next"`
3. Added `<SpeedInsights />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after the `</Providers>` closing tag and before the `</body>` closing tag

### Technical Approach:
- For Next.js 16.1.6 with App Router, the implementation follows the recommended pattern:
  - Import from `@vercel/speed-insights/next` (already present)
  - Add the self-contained `<SpeedInsights />` component to the root layout
  - No additional props or configuration needed - the component automatically detects routes

### Verification Steps Completed:
1. ✅ Dependencies installed using `npm install`
2. ✅ Build completed successfully with `npm run build`
3. ✅ Linter verified no new errors introduced in layout.tsx
4. ✅ The component is now properly integrated and will track page performance metrics

## Notes:
- The SpeedInsights component is a client component that automatically instruments the application
- It will collect Core Web Vitals and other performance metrics when deployed to Vercel
- The component is lightweight and won't impact application performance
- No additional configuration is required - it works out of the box with Next.js App Router
